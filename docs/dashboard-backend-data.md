# Dashboard: backend data requirements

What the backend needs to answer, and in what format, to replace the dummy data on the student dashboard and every page in its menu.

Only what the backend needs to provide is listed. Everything else stays fixed in the frontend.

## Conventions

- Every response uses the existing wrapper `{ "status": true, "data": ... }`; lists use `{ count, next, previous, results: [] }`.
- Dates are ISO 8601 (`"2026-07-10"`, `"2026-07-06T17:00:00+05:30"`). The frontend formats "8 days left", "Today · 09:12" and similar text, so the backend sends raw dates, not pre-formatted strings.
- Every image or file field is a full URL, or `null`.
- ✅ = endpoint exists and the live dashboard already calls it. 🆕 = new.

# Global (sidebar, topbar, settings: on every page)

## Feature: user identity
- Who is the logged-in user? ✅ `GET users/me/` already returns `first_name`, `last_name`, `profile_picture`, `is_email_verified`, `is_onboarding_completed`, `is_approved`, `signup_platform_type`.
- Can `users/me/` also return the user's **journey stage**? The sidebar shows it under the name ("Explorer", "Applicant", "Job seeker").
    - Format needed (added to `users/me/`):
    ```json
    {
        "journey_stage": "aspirant | applicant | admitted | in_germany | working",
        "journey_stage_label": "string"
    }
    ```

## Feature: profile (name and photo), with a prompt when missing
Shown everywhere: the greeting ("Good Morning, Tino!"), the sidebar user card, the topbar avatar and the settings dialog. When the user has no name or no photo yet, the dashboard asks for it (a "complete your profile" dialog on first visit, and editable later in settings). First and last name are separate fields.
- ✅ `GET users/me/` already returns `first_name`, `last_name` and `profile_picture`. When one is missing, does it come back as `null` or `""`? Please pick one and keep it the same everywhere.
- Some accounts seem to store the full name in `first_name` (the frontend splits it on the first space). Can the backend clean this up so `first_name` and `last_name` are always separate?
- Can `users/me/` say which profile fields are missing, so the frontend doesn't have to guess when to show the prompt?
- Does onboarding already collect the name? If so, which users can still reach the dashboard without one (for example invite-only or old accounts)?
- Can the user skip the prompt? If so, should the backend remember that they skipped (so the prompt doesn't show on every visit)?
- Is `gender` available? The frontend uses it to pick a placeholder 3D avatar until a photo is uploaded; without it, a neutral one is used.
    - Format needed (in `users/me/`):
    ```json
    {
        "first_name": "string | null",
        "last_name": "string | null",
        "profile_picture": "string | null",
        "gender": "male | female | other | null",
        "missing_profile_fields": ["first_name", "last_name", "profile_picture"],
        "profile_prompt_dismissed_at": "ISO | null"
    }
    ```
- Update name: 🆕 `PATCH users/me/` `{ "first_name": "string", "last_name": "string" }` returns the updated user. What are the validation rules (required, max length, allowed characters)?
- Upload photo: 🆕 `POST users/me/profile-picture/` (multipart `file`) returns `{ "profile_picture": "URL" }`. Which types and size limit (suggest JPG/PNG/WebP, 5 MB)? Does the backend crop or resize it? Is the photo URL public or signed (and if signed, how long does it last)?
- Remove photo: 🆕 `DELETE users/me/profile-picture/` (the frontend then shows the placeholder avatar again).
- Dismiss prompt: 🆕 `POST users/me/profile-prompt/dismiss/`, or a `profile_prompt_dismissed_at` field set with the `PATCH`.

## Feature: user tier
There is one tier question: is the user a paid LTA client or not.
- **Free:** Course Shortlisting.
- **Paid:** Course Shortlisting and Zenna.
- The frontend derives every lock, lock screen and access tag from this one field, so no separate entitlement endpoint is needed.
- Is the user a paid client?
- Once LTA Connect is live, is it for everyone or only for paid users?
    - Format needed (added to `users/me/`):
    ```json
    { "is_paid": true }
    ```

## Feature: WhatsApp updates toggle (topbar and settings dialog)
- Are WhatsApp updates on or off for this user?
- Which number do messages go to? The user's phone number should be part of the user data.
- Can the user switch updates on or off? 🆕 `PATCH users/me/` `{ "whatsapp_enabled": false }` returns the updated user.
    - Format needed (added to `users/me/`):
    ```json
    {
        "phone_number": "+919876543210",
        "whatsapp_enabled": true
    }
    ```

## Feature: log out
- Is there a logout endpoint that invalidates the refresh token (for example 🆕 `POST auth/logout/`), or does the frontend only clear cookies?

---

# Page: Dashboard (Home)

### Feature: greeting
- User's first name. ✅ From `users/me/`. Time of day is calculated on the frontend.

### Feature: Zenna recommendations carousel (university cards)
- Does the user have any universities or courses shortlisted for them? ✅ `GET shortlisted-courses/` exists but is missing most fields the card shows.
- If the list is empty, what should the card area show? A prompt to use Course Shortlisting?
    - Format needed:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": "string",
            "rank": 1,
            "matching_score": 80,
            "college_id": "string",
            "college_name": "string",
            "college_short_name": "TUM",
            "college_location": "Munich, Germany",
            "college_logo_url": "string",
            "college_image_url": "string",
            "course_id": "string",
            "course_name": "M.Sc. Technology of Biogenic Resources",
            "course_duration_years": 4,
            "course_fee": { "amount": 40000, "currency": "EUR", "label": "Starting: 40k" },
            "start_semesters": ["winter"],
            "application_deadline": "2026-10-15"
        }
    ]
    ```
    The frontend calculates "10 days left" from `application_deadline`. Is `course_fee` tuition or cost of living? The current API only has `cost_of_living`.

### Feature: Upcoming events + calendar
- Does the user have any upcoming events (LTA webinars, workshops)?
- Which of the user's own booked sessions fall in the selected month? These mark calendar days. ✅ `GET booked-slot/` exists. Can it take a `?from=&to=` month filter?
- Who is each booked session with? `booked-slot/` only returns `name`, which is the student's own name, so the calendar can only say "Session with <your name>". It needs the mentor's name and photo, and the session topic, like `booked-slot/upcoming/` has:
    ```json
    { "mentor_profile": { "full_name": "string", "profile_picture": "string | null" }, "topic": "string", "join_url": "string | null" }
    ```
- Are events the same for everyone, or targeted by intake or field?
- Can the user register for an event? If so, what is the register endpoint, and what is the join link?
    - Format needed: 🆕 `GET events/?from=2026-02-01&to=2026-02-28`
    ```json
    [
        {
            "event_id": "string",
            "event_type": "webinar | workshop | mentor_session | lta_team_call",
            "event_name": "string",
            "event_description": "string",
            "event_image_url": "string",
            "start_at": "2026-05-30T09:00:00+05:30",
            "end_at": "2026-05-30T10:00:00+05:30",
            "mode": "online | offline",
            "event_location": "string | null",
            "join_url": "string | null",
            "is_registered": false
        }
    ]
    ```

### Feature: Hear from our family (testimonials)
- Are testimonials fixed, or managed by the backend or CMS?
    - Format: 🆕 `GET testimonials/`
    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "course_name": "M.Sc. Logistics and Production (ISE)",
            "university_name": "string",
            "photo_url": "string",
            "quote": "string"
        }
    ]
    ```

### What the live dashboard calls today
- The dashboard calls only ✅ `users/me/`, ✅ `shortlisted-courses/` (Home cards) and ✅ `booked-slot/` (Home calendar). Every other page shows empty states until the endpoints below exist.
- ✅ `students/me/stats/`, ✅ `applications/` and ✅ `booked-slot/upcoming/` exist but are no longer called. They should come back through the Zenna and Connect formats below.

---

# Page: Documents

### Feature: document vault list
- Which documents has the user uploaded?
- Which documents has LTA verified?
- Which products or applications use each document? (the "USED IN" badges)
- Is there a required-documents checklist? Applications show "1 doc missing", so the backend must know what is required.
    - Format: 🆕 `GET documents/`
    ```json
    [
        {
            "document_id": "string",
            "file_name": "Passport_TinoSunny.pdf",
            "document_type": "passport | transcript | ielts | german_certificate | offer_letter | other",
            "mime_type": "application/pdf",
            "size_bytes": 482133,
            "uploaded_at": "2026-03-12T10:00:00Z",
            "verification_status": "pending | verified | rejected",
            "rejection_reason": "string | null",
            "used_in": ["zenna", "course_shortlisting"],
            "preview_url": "signed URL",
            "download_url": "signed URL"
        }
    ]
    ```
    - Missing documents format: `[ { "document_type": "string", "label": "string", "required_for": "application_id" } ]`

### Feature: upload / delete
- Upload endpoint: 🆕 `POST documents/` (multipart with `file` + `document_type`), or presigned S3 upload?
- Are the frontend limits right (PDF, JPG or PNG, 10 MB max)? The backend must enforce the same limits.
- Can a verified document, or one used by an application, be deleted? 🆕 `DELETE documents/{id}/`

---

# Page: Notifications

### Feature: notification feed
- What notifications does the user have, across every product?
- Which page and item should each notification open? For example, the DIT deadline notice should open that application.
- Does the backend create notifications when things happen (booking confirmed, offer received, AI found a deadline)?
- Should the page update live (WebSocket/SSE), or refresh on page load or by polling?
    - Format: 🆕 `GET notifications/?page=`
    ```json
    [
        {
            "notification_id": "string",
            "message": "DIT portal submission due in 8 days — Zenna is tracking it.",
            "product": "zenna | connect | course_shortlisting | documents | support | account",
            "target_id": "application id / session id / null",
            "created_at": "2026-07-02T08:00:00Z",
            "is_read": false
        }
    ]
    ```
- The sidebar count and the topbar dot are counted on the frontend from `is_read` in this list, so no separate unread-count endpoint is needed.
- Mark as read: 🆕 `PATCH notifications/{id}/` `{ "is_read": true }`. Is a "mark all read" endpoint needed too?

---

# Page: Support

### Feature: help channels
- WhatsApp number, support email and reply-time text: fixed or config? (Currently hardcoded as `info@letterstoabroad.com`.)

### Feature: book a free 15-minute call with the LTA team
- Which LTA team slots are free this month?
- Does the user already have team calls booked? These show at the top of the page.
    - Format: 🆕 `GET team-calls/availability/?month=2026-07`
    ```json
    [ { "slot_id": "string", "start_at": "ISO", "end_at": "ISO" } ]
    ```
    - Book: 🆕 `POST team-calls/` `{ "slot_id": "string", "context": "optional text, e.g. CST results" }` returns `{ "booking_id", "start_at", "join_url" }`

### Feature: FAQs
- Fixed text, or managed by the backend or CMS? Format if backend: `[ { "question": "string", "answer": "string" } ]`

---

# Page: Zenna (application tracker)

### Feature: access
- Zenna is unlocked when `is_paid` is true. Nothing else is needed for the lock screen.

### Feature: summary stats
- How many applications does the user have?
- How many offers?
- What is the average completion?
- What is the next deadline, and for which university? ✅ `students/me/stats/` exists but returns different fields.
    - Format needed:
    ```json
    {
        "total_applications": 9,
        "offers_received": 2,
        "average_completion": 74,
        "next_deadline": { "application_id": "string", "university_short_name": "DIT", "date": "2026-07-10" },
        "status_counts": { "offer": 2, "in_progress": 2, "waiting": 2, "closed": 3 }
    }
    ```

### Feature: applications list + filter + detail
- ✅ `GET applications/` exists. Missing: status group, deadline, next action, university short code.
    - Format needed:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "application_id": "string",
            "university_name": "Deggendorf Institute of Technology",
            "university_short_name": "DIT",
            "university_logo_url": "string",
            "course_name": "International Management",
            "intake": "Winter 2026",
            "status": "in_progress | in_review | submitted | offer_received | enrolled | rejected | withdrawn",
            "status_label": "In progress",
            "status_group": "in_progress | waiting | offer | closed",
            "progress": 82,
            "next_deadline": "2026-07-10",
            "next_action": "Portal submission | Confirm enrolment | 1 doc missing | Decision late July",
            "missing_documents": ["string"],
            "offer_letter_url": "string | null",
            "update_viewed": false
        }
    ]
    ```

### Feature: Zenna AI agent (deadlines found in the user's documents)
- Did the AI find any deadlines in the user's documents? For each: which document, and how confident is it?
- Can the user confirm the findings (which schedules reminders) or dismiss them?
    - Format: 🆕 `GET zenna/ai-findings/`
    ```json
    [
        {
            "finding_id": "string",
            "title": "Blocked-account proof due",
            "due_date": "2026-07-10",
            "source_document_id": "string",
            "source_document_name": "Visa Checklist — Deggendorf IT.pdf",
            "confidence": 91,
            "state": "pending | confirmed | dismissed"
        }
    ]
    ```
    - Actions: 🆕 `POST zenna/ai-findings/{id}/confirm/` and `.../dismiss/`, or bulk?

### Feature: WhatsApp updates card
- Who is the user's assigned application mentor (currently "Jisha")?
    - Format: `{ "counsellor": { "name": "string", "photo_url": "string | null", "whatsapp_url": "string" } }`

---

# Page: LTA Connect

### Feature: access / waitlist
- Connect is not open yet. Once it opens, free users see it locked only if it is paid-only (see the tier question).
- Join the waitlist: 🆕 `POST connect/waitlist/`. Can `users/me/` return `"connect_waitlisted": true`, so the button shows "You're on the list"?

### Feature: next session + booked sessions
- ✅ `booked-slot/upcoming/` and `booked-slot/` exist. Missing: session topic and meeting link.
    - Additions needed: `{ "topic": "Course selection for Technical Logistics", "join_url": "string | null", "mode": "video" }`

### Feature: mentors picked for your profile
- Which mentors are recommended for this user, and how are they matched (field, university, intake)?
    - Format: 🆕 `GET connect/mentors/recommended/`
    ```json
    [
        {
            "mentor_id": "string",
            "full_name": "Geen Geo",
            "profile_picture": "string | null",
            "headline": "M.Sc. Logistics & Production · TU München",
            "tags": ["Mechanical", "TUM admits", "Winter intake"],
            "rating": 4.9,
            "sessions_count": 41,
            "price": { "amount": "string", "currency": "INR" }
        }
    ]
    ```

### Feature: book / reschedule a 1:1
- **Key decision:** are bookings made inside the dashboard, or does the dashboard link out to `connect.letterstoabroad.com` as the Figma dialog does? If inside the dashboard:
    - Which slots does this mentor have free in a given month? 🆕 `GET connect/mentors/{id}/availability/?month=` returns `[ { "slot_id", "start_at", "end_at" } ]`
    - Is booking paid? `order_status` and `amount` suggest Razorpay. If so, what is the order and payment flow?
    - Book: `POST booked-slot/` `{ "slot_id" }`. Reschedule: 🆕 `PATCH booked-slot/{id}/` `{ "slot_id" }`. What is the cancellation or reschedule policy?

---

# Page: Course Shortlisting (admit-chance checker)

### Feature: profile form
- Where do the dropdown options come from (bachelor degrees, target fields, German levels, CGPA/IELTS ranges)? Currently hardcoded to 4 degrees and 4 fields.
- Can the form be pre-filled from the user's onboarding data?
    - Format: 🆕 `GET cst/options/`
    ```json
    {
        "degrees": ["string"],
        "fields": ["string"],
        "german_levels": ["none", "A1", "A2", "B1", "B2"],
        "cgpa": { "min": 5, "max": 10 },
        "ielts": { "min": 5, "max": 9 },
        "prefill": { "degree": "string", "cgpa": 7.8, "ielts": 7, "german_level": "A2", "field": "string" }
    }
    ```

### Feature: calculate chances
- **Key decision:** does the backend calculate the percentages? The frontend currently runs a made-up formula with invented "difficulty" values, so the numbers are not real.
- Are the results saved? Do they become the user's `shortlisted-courses` (the dashboard carousel)?
- If saved, can the page load the last report when it opens? 🆕 `GET cst/report/` returns `{ "checked_at": "ISO", "profile": { ... }, "results": [ ...same as below ] }`, or `null` if the user never ran a check.
    - Format: 🆕 `POST cst/check/` `{ "degree", "cgpa", "ielts", "german_level", "field" }` returns
    ```json
    [
        {
            "course_id": "string",
            "university_name": "string",
            "university_short_name": "TUM",
            "university_logo_url": "string",
            "course_name": "string",
            "admit_chance": 80,
            "band": "strong | fair | low"
        }
    ]
    ```
- "Talk to our team about these results" opens team booking with the results as `context`, reusing the Support endpoint.

# Summary

**Already there, needs extra fields:** `users/me/` (journey stage, `is_paid`, gender, phone number, `whatsapp_enabled`, missing profile fields; plus new endpoints to update the name, WhatsApp setting and photo), `booked-slot/` (mentor name and photo, topic), `shortlisted-courses/` (logo, image, location, duration, fee, deadline), `applications/` (status group, deadline, next action, short code), `students/me/stats/` (Zenna summary shape), and `booked-slot/` / `booked-slot/upcoming/` (topic, join link, month filter).

**Entirely new, roughly in priority order:**
1. `is_paid`. Every lock, lock screen and access tag depends on it, so it unblocks the most.
2. Profile update: name and photo upload. It's small, and every page shows the name and photo.
3. Notifications.
4. Documents.
5. Events.
6. Connect: mentors, availability and booking.
7. Team-call booking.
8. Course Shortlisting check.
9. Zenna AI findings.

**Could stay as fixed frontend text if the team prefers:** testimonials, FAQs and help channels. Each is listed as a question above so the team can decide rather than build them by default.

**Decisions needed before backend work starts:**
- Are Connect bookings made inside the dashboard, or by linking to the Connect site?
- Does the backend calculate Course Shortlisting percentages (the current frontend formula is fake), and do the results feed the dashboard carousel?
- Do notifications update live, or on page load?
